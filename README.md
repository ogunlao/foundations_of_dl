# Foundations of Deep Learning

> Tutorials and classwork exploring deep learning algorithms and frameworks

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks exploring various deep learning architectures and libraries for a deep learning foundations class.

## Getting started

A good knowledge of machine learning is required. Also, most of the codes are written in pytorch so it may be a good idea to start with the `pytorch_intro` and `pytorch_basics` notebooks in this repo. For a more thorough pytorch tutorial, visit the [official pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

To get a copy of the notebooks, run the following command in your terminal;

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ogunlao/foundations_of_deeplearning
```

The code above fetches the `foundations_of_deeplearning` repository and saves it into your folder.

## What is covered

- Pytorch basics
- Convolution from scratch
- Natural Language Processing basics
- Auto Encoders
- Variational AutoEncoders (VAE)
- Transfer Learning
- TensorBoard
- DataLoaders
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- CNN Architectures (ResNet)

Most algorithms require pytorch and may require GPU for faster computation. It is advisable to run notebooks on google colab.
